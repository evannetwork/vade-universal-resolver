//! This crate allows you to use to work with DIDs Trust and Trace, which runs on evan.network.
//! For this purpose a [`VadePlugin`] implementations is exported: [`VadeEvanSubstrate`].
//!
//! ## VadeEvanSubstrate
//!
//! Supports creating, updating and getting DIDs and DID documents on substrate, therefore supports:
//!
//! - [`did_create`]
//! - [`did_resolve`]
//! - [`did_update`]
//!
//! ### Signing substrate requests
//!
//! As the did resolver instance needs to sign its requests against substrate, a remote endpoint for signing has to be provided. The DID resolver will sign requests for [`did_create`] and [`did_update`]. A signing endpoint has to be passed with the config argument in the constructor, e.g.:
//!
//!
//! `signing_url` will be called with a POST request. The messages that should be signed is passed to the server alongside a reference to a key like this:
//!
//! ```json
//! {
//!     "key": "some-key-id",
//!     "type": "some-key-type",
//!     "message": "sign me please"
//! }
//! ```
//!
//! Two types of of responses are supported. Successful signing results are give in this format:
//!
//! ```json
//! {
//!   "messageHash": "0x52091d1299031b18c1099620a1786363855d9fcd91a7686c866ad64f83de13ff",
//!   "signature": "0xc465a9499b75eed6fc4f658d1764168d63578b05ae15305ceedc94872bda793f74cb850c0683287b245b4da523851fbbe37738116635ebdb08e80b867c0b4aea1b",
//!   "signerAddress": "0x3daa2c354dba8d51fdabc30cf9219b251c74eb56"
//! }
//! ```
//!
//! Errors can be signaled this way:
//!
//! ```json
//! {
//!     "error": "key not found"
//! }
//! ```
//!
//! ## Compiling vade-evan-substrate
//!
//! ### "Regular" build
//!
//! No surprise here:
//!
//! ```sh
//! cargo build --release
//! ```
//!
//! ### WASM
//!
//! To compile `vade-evan-substrate` for wasm, use wasm pack.
//!
//! Also you have to specify whether to build a browser or a nodejs environment.
//!
//! nodejs:
//!
//! ```sh
//! wasm-pack build --release --target nodejs
//! ```
//!
//! browser:
//!
//! ```sh
//! wasm-pack build --release --target web
//! ```
